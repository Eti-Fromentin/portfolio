        Back in the 2002 I graduated in Japanese Studies, and began to work in a
        japanese restaurant in Paris. This job began my career, from server, to
        manager, to director, in some of the best japanese restaurant in Paris.{" "}

        Ask me about sushi üç£ !<br />
        A few years ago, I got tired of it and got in my head I had to change my
        life. <br />
        And what could be better than an old hobby of mine to do that? So I
        began to think seriously about programming, and even tried to make a few
        applications for mobile using Flutter. <br />
        And now, I am at the Wild Code School in Paris, learning all about
        Javascript, ReactJs, NodeJs, Express, MySql, and more to come; and I am
        very interested to get into React Native and back to Flutter.
        <br />
        This is just the beginning...
